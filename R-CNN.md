- ## Summary
	- **Architecture**: input image -> extracting region proposals (~2k) -> feature-extraction [[Convolutional Neural Network, CNN|CNN]] -> class prediction or bounding box regression [[Support Vector Machine, SVM|SVM]] (or both).
		- [[Intersection Over Union, IoU]] with ground truth labels should be greater than 0.5.
		- At test time, [[Intersection Over Union, IoU|IoU]] is used to select the dominating prediction for a region.
		- With the enabled bounding box [[Regression]], the model learns to predict shifts of the predicted bounding box relative to the coordinates of the proposed region.
	- R-CNN can scale to thousands of classes without resorting to hierarchical tricks or [[Hash Function|Hashing]].
	- **[[Training Process|Training]] process** consists of two parts.
		- Supervised pre-training happens on a big [[Classification]] dataset to make the CNN part learn without overfitting on (usually) small detection datasets.
		- Domain-specific fine-tuning is used to train SVM heads on region proposals.
			- Those proposals should fit $227 \times 227$ pixels so they are usually warped.
	- Different CNN architectures yield different [[Mean Average Precision, mAP|mAPs]] but also require different amount of [[Compute]].
	- For region proposals, [[Selective Search]] is used but other methods are appropriate too.
	- For [[Semantic Segmentation]], [[Constrained Parametric Min-Cuts, CPMC]] is used.
